But this Thursday’s celebration also carries another, more complex layer of meaning.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Thursday marks exactly 75 years since the June 14, 1943, ruling in West Virginia State Board of Education v. Barnette, in which the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that expelling a student who doesn’t recite the Pledge of Allegiance — one of the best-known everyday celebrations of that same flag — violates the Constitution’s guarantee of freedom of speech and religion.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The anniversary of this decision is a reminder that debates about the proper way to respect the flag, and other national symbols, shows no signs of flagging.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Walter Barnett (whose name was misspelled by the courts) sued the West Virginia school board after the public Slip Hill Grade School near Charleston expelled his daughters Marie, 8, and Gathie, 9, after they refused to recite the pledge because it violated their family’s religious beliefs as Jehovah’s Witnesses who view the gesture as a form of idolatry. Around the same time, Jehovah’s Witnesses in Germany <a href=# rel=noopener>refused</a> to salute Hitler, so the Nazis sent them to concentration camps. But the timing wasn’t just a coincidence: The more World War II raged in Europe, and especially after the U.S. entry following the attack on Pearl Harbor, the more importance was attached to such patriotic American rituals, and the less tolerance there was for those who did not participate in them wholeheartedly. The religious group had also come under fire for the way in which members promulgated their faith. TIME reported back then that adherents were viewed as <a href=#>“freakish.”</a></p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In a 6-3 decision, the Supreme Court ruled that the state couldn’t force students to pledge allegiance to the flag if it violated their religious beliefs. Concurring justices admitted it was <a href=# rel=noopener>“wrong”</a> to have ruled 8-1 three years earlier in favor of a Pennsylvania school that expelled two Jehovah’s Witness school children by arguing that “national cohesion” was necessary for “national security” in <i>Gobitis v. Minersville School District</i> (1940).</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Or as <a href=#>TIME put it more bluntly back then</a>, “The U.S. Supreme Court reaffirmed its faith in the Bill of Rights—which, in 1940, it had come perilously close to outlawing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The decision highlighted a somewhat paradoxical but crucial facet of patriotism in a land that prizes liberty: per the Supreme Court’s decision in that case, the government’s forcing people to show their love of country in any particular way undermines the country they’re supposed to love.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“To believe that patriotism will not flourish if patriotic ceremonies are voluntary and spontaneous, instead of a compulsory routine, is to make an unflattering estimate of the appeal of our institutions to free minds,” Justice Robert H. Jackson wrote in his <a href=# rel=noopener>opinion</a> announcing the Court’s decision. “If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation, it is that no official, high or petty, can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics, nationalism, religion, or other matters of opinion, or force citizens to confess by word or act their faith therein… Those who begin coercive elimination of dissent soon find themselves exterminating dissenters. Compulsory unification of opinion achieves only the unanimity of the graveyard.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">However, the ruling didn’t stop states from trying to find loopholes — or put an end to the larger philosophical debate at hand.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“The states kept (and keep) trying to enact mandatory Pledge laws,” says Marc Leepson, author of Flag: An American Biography, “such as requiring students to opt out, get a note from parents, or requiring [the objecting] student to go in the corridor while the others were reciting. But all have been ruled unconstitutional.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During the 1988 presidential campaign, George H.W. Bush villainized Massachusetts Governor Michael Dukakis for vetoing one of these laws, one that required teachers to lead students in the Pledge of Allegiance. Bush’s implication that Dukakis was unpatriotic — “What is it about the Pledge of Allegiance that upsets him so much?” Bush asked in stump speeches — was <a href=#>slammed by TIME</a> back then for having “nothing to do with the duties of the President of the U.S.” (As to Bush saying it’s “very hard” to “imagine” the Founding Fathers objecting to such a bill, TIME wrote, “It is hard to imagine the Founding Fathers being concerned with the pledge at all, since it was written 116 years after they penned the Declaration of Independence.”)</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Barnette has also been cited in free speech cases not related to the flag. Justice John G. Roberts brought up Barnette when he delivered the opinion in a 2013 <a href=# rel=noopener>decision</a> ruling that it was <a href=# rel=noopener>unconstitutional</a> for the government to make organizations declare their opposition to prostitution in order to receive federal funding for international family planning initiatives. “The government can decide to fund family planning or not, but you can’t make the counselor recite the government’s script,” says John Q. Barrett, a professor who teaches Constitutional Law at St. John’s University School of Law and is on the board of the Robert H. Jackson Center, in Jamestown, N.Y. And just recently, the Supreme Court cited Barnette in opinions supporting <a href=#>a Colorado baker’s right to refuse baking a cake</a> for a same-sex wedding. “Thomas argued that the Colorado Court of Appeals was trying to compel the baker to speak by selling the cake to people who were going to celebrate a wedding that offended his religious beliefs and that that’s inconsistent with Barnette,” says Barrett.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Nevertheless, these days a different <a href=#>heated debate</a> about mandatory displays of patriotism is likely to come to mind: the question of whether NFL players should be forced to stand during the national anthem.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Though Barnette doesn’t really speak directly to the NFL protest case — the NFL is not the government, and its rules apply to individuals as employees rather than as citizens — Barrett says that the Supreme Court’s ruling still has something to say about the matter. Forced displays of patriotism are “philosophically inconsistent with the freedom that the First Amendment stands for, according to the Barnette case,” he argues.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">And that connection may one day be more than merely philosophical.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There are arguments that people make that the NFL is not just a private actor, that the president has pushed the NFL to do this, or that the NFL is quasi-governmental or connected to the government because lots of cities and states have used public money to build the football stadiums. And those issues may well be litigated,” Barrett adds. “That may be next year’s Barnette litigation.”</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZua2FmgXJ9jp%2Bjmp9dma66eceiqq2noq56tMHPq5ymnV2YvLa%2B02anpZ2UnLJw</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fflag-day-history-supreme-court-pledge.html&text=Flag%20Day%20Falls%20on%20Anniversary%20of%20Pledge%20of%20Allegiance%20Case&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fflag-day-history-supreme-court-pledge.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fflag-day-history-supreme-court-pledge.html&title=Flag%20Day%20Falls%20on%20Anniversary%20of%20Pledge%20of%20Allegiance%20Case" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fflag-day-history-supreme-court-pledge.html&title=Flag%20Day%20Falls%20on%20Anniversary%20of%20Pledge%20of%20Allegiance%20Case" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fflag-day-history-supreme-court-pledge.html&title=Flag%20Day%20Falls%20on%20Anniversary%20of%20Pledge%20of%20Allegiance%20Case" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fflag-day-history-supreme-court-pledge.html&description=Flag%20Day%20Falls%20on%20Anniversary%20of%20Pledge%20of%20Allegiance%20Case" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./jason-momoa-and-emilia-clarke-had-a-game-of-thrones-reunion-backstage-at-the-oscars.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Jason Momoa and Emilia Clarke had a 'Game of Thrones' reunion backstage at the Oscars">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./theza-consomme-lenergie-quelle-produit-sur-ses-batiments-communaux-66.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Autoconsommation lectrique  Thza (66)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
