Instead of&nbsp;asking her himself, he&nbsp;sent his parents. She found herself at&nbsp;a&nbsp;crossroads, faced with the tough decision of&nbsp;revealing to&nbsp;his parents the true nature of&nbsp;their son. In&nbsp;a&nbsp;heartfelt letter, she shared her dilemma and sought advice from our readers.</p><p><h2>Despite everything going wrong in&nbsp;her relationship long ago, Anna remained committed.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/d83/268/725c8655568bb9c5a8e9531f26.jpg><p>Anna opened her letter, saying, “My&nbsp;husband of&nbsp;10&nbsp;years, Nick, has had this female ’friend’ that always made my&nbsp;life uneasy. She never respected boundaries, and when Nick and&nbsp;I first started dating, she told everyone&nbsp;I was with him for his wealth. Nick earns significantly more than I&nbsp;do but never gives me&nbsp;any money. We&nbsp;used to&nbsp;split the bills equally, and we&nbsp;both bought food. I&nbsp;took care of&nbsp;food for our 5-month-old baby and paid for all needs of&nbsp;my&nbsp;oldest child, from my&nbsp;previous marriage.”</p><p>“Over the past 8&nbsp;years, I&nbsp;have experienced this ’friend’ spreading <a href=# title=rumors data-link=tag>rumors</a> and being disrespectful. I&nbsp;confronted Nick about&nbsp;it, and he&nbsp;said that were ’petty ladies’ issues’. He&nbsp;never wanted to&nbsp;set boundaries, and&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;set this woman straight a&nbsp;couple of&nbsp;times myself.”</p><p><h2>The situation was steadily deteriorating.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/124/054/957ab45cc6a582e06eeb51d12e.jpg><p>She goes on&nbsp;with her story, saying, “Recently, the rumor campaign of&nbsp;this ’friend’ started all over again. Nick and&nbsp;I bought a&nbsp;house. This vile lady told everyone that&nbsp;I didn’t invest a&nbsp;cent in&nbsp;our new home. I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;confront her immediately, and&nbsp;I yelled at&nbsp;her, asking her not to&nbsp;poke her nose in&nbsp;our private matters. The lady called Nick and told him&nbsp;I was rude to&nbsp;her, he&nbsp;was upset.”</p><p>“My&nbsp;husband came home totally stressed and anxious. I&nbsp;asked him if&nbsp;he&nbsp;was okay, and he&nbsp;refused to&nbsp;talk. Later&nbsp;on, that night, when the kids went to&nbsp;bed, and&nbsp;I pushed him into the conversation, he&nbsp;told me&nbsp;that he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;moment of&nbsp;weakness with this gossiping ’friend’, and now she was pregnant, and he&nbsp;didn’t want to&nbsp;lose his <a href=# title=family data-link=tag>family</a>,” she continued.</p><p>Anna added, “I&nbsp;was dumbfounded, I&nbsp;felt broken and betrayed, and&nbsp;I began to&nbsp;cry. Nick kept saying how sorry he&nbsp;was ane didn’t want to&nbsp;lose his family. I&nbsp;didn’t say anything, but just went to&nbsp;my&nbsp;toddler’s room and locked the door.”</p><p><h2>She confronted the heartbreak with courage, yet a&nbsp;new dilemma emerged.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/7be/efc/c77415505b8828dded0575a052.jpg><p>This is&nbsp;where the dilemma begins. Anna revealed, “The next morning, I&nbsp;asked for some time off from my&nbsp;work. I&nbsp;then took the kids and went to&nbsp;my&nbsp;father’s house. I&nbsp;explained everything to&nbsp;my&nbsp;dad, and he&nbsp;was upset. Nick came home and didn’t find me&nbsp;there, so&nbsp;he&nbsp;blew up&nbsp;my&nbsp;phone, but&nbsp;I blocked him.<br>Last afternoon, my&nbsp;in-laws showed up&nbsp;at&nbsp;my&nbsp;father’s home. They were begging me&nbsp;to&nbsp;go&nbsp;back home and end this ’unnecessary and stupid disagreement.’ I&nbsp;was so&nbsp;stressed and shocked that&nbsp;I yelled that they raised a&nbsp;real monster, and his mother went pale at&nbsp;that very moment.”</p><p>“His parents were shocked because they believed that our <a href=# title=relationship data-link=tag>relationship</a> was just going through some crisis and nothing more. They always believed that their son treated me&nbsp;well and that&nbsp;I just didn’t know what else&nbsp;I could demand from him.<br>They then asked me&nbsp;to&nbsp;explain. I&nbsp;paused and told them that their son was a&nbsp;liar, a&nbsp;cheater, and a&nbsp;person who made my&nbsp;life unbearable, that he&nbsp;didn’t value his family and even a&nbsp;baby didn’t become the reason for him to&nbsp;stop cheating and lying. His mom was visibly upset, and his dad just left without saying a&nbsp;word, but later he&nbsp;called me&nbsp;and said he&nbsp;would handle everything.”</p><p><h2>The situation within the family has become entirely unhealthy.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8d2/542/814cf259c2855641a4032fce8a.jpg><p>Anna confessed, “I&nbsp;know that my&nbsp;MIL has issues with her heart and that she has to&nbsp;be&nbsp;protected from any bad news. I&nbsp;also know that my&nbsp;FIL will make my&nbsp;husband’s life hell after he&nbsp;finds out everything he&nbsp;did to&nbsp;me. My&nbsp;husband has been calling me&nbsp;from different numbers since then, and he&nbsp;blames me&nbsp;for everything, he&nbsp;said&nbsp;I shouldn’t have told his parents about his affair. He&nbsp;said that would kill them and his relationship with them, too.”</p><p>“I&nbsp;feel guilty about this, and&nbsp;I think that we&nbsp;could’ve divorced without saying a&nbsp;word to&nbsp;his parents, without this unnecessary explanation. But at&nbsp;the same time, I&nbsp;couldn’t bear this burden anymore, and&nbsp;I needed to&nbsp;explain to&nbsp;his parents why&nbsp;I wouldn’t get back to&nbsp;their son for anything in&nbsp;the world. I’m torn by&nbsp;my&nbsp;emotions. What would you&nbsp;do?”</p><p>And here’s yet another shocking revelation, that was made by&nbsp;a&nbsp;woman, who overheard a&nbsp;secret <a href=# title=communication data-link=tag>communication</a> between her husband with his work buddies. <a href=#><strong>She turned to&nbsp;the online community</strong></a> for insights on&nbsp;navigating this painful revelation and determining her next course of&nbsp;action.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLq6eceuqpuZnpl6o7jAppysZZ2aeqe70WarnqScnruoecyyZKKmXaGuuL%2BMrZ%2BeZZSewKjB0q2gp59dqb%2B2wMdmmJunpal6qbXMZm9qcWNrf3A%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fmy-husband-blames-me-for-telling-my-in-laws-the-disgusting-truth-about-him-819362.html&text=My%20Husband%20Blames%20Me%20for%20Telling%20My%20In-Laws%20the%20Disgusting%20Truth%20About%20Him&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fmy-husband-blames-me-for-telling-my-in-laws-the-disgusting-truth-about-him-819362.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fmy-husband-blames-me-for-telling-my-in-laws-the-disgusting-truth-about-him-819362.html&title=My%20Husband%20Blames%20Me%20for%20Telling%20My%20In-Laws%20the%20Disgusting%20Truth%20About%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fmy-husband-blames-me-for-telling-my-in-laws-the-disgusting-truth-about-him-819362.html&title=My%20Husband%20Blames%20Me%20for%20Telling%20My%20In-Laws%20the%20Disgusting%20Truth%20About%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fmy-husband-blames-me-for-telling-my-in-laws-the-disgusting-truth-about-him-819362.html&title=My%20Husband%20Blames%20Me%20for%20Telling%20My%20In-Laws%20the%20Disgusting%20Truth%20About%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fmy-husband-blames-me-for-telling-my-in-laws-the-disgusting-truth-about-him-819362.html&description=My%20Husband%20Blames%20Me%20for%20Telling%20My%20In-Laws%20the%20Disgusting%20Truth%20About%20Him" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./prevalence-de-la-perte-dautonomie-pourquoi-tant-decarts-entre-departements.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="pourquoi tant d'carts entre dpartements ?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./48473-more-than-a-third-of-under-40s-would-refuse-conscription-in-the-event-of-a-world-war.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="More than a third of under-40s would refuse conscription in the event of a world war">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
