However, when the daughter asked to&nbsp;move&nbsp;in, Emily felt she couldn’t simply say&nbsp;no. She agreed but made it&nbsp;clear that her stepdaughter would need to&nbsp;respect her rules. Emily didn’t expect her request to&nbsp;lead to&nbsp;family <a href=# title=drama data-link=tag>drama</a> and conflict, so&nbsp;she turned to&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> seeking advice.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bfa/745/7b9a4653c18ffea8de6c2e9167.jpg><p>Children of divorce catch on at a very early on how to manipulate and pit their parents against each other. 6</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/00b/ee6/f236cb51359742039d5b5d4e57.jpg><p>Your children can live there but his child can't is what your saying. Hope your husband isn't surprised and knows who's to blame when she goes no contact.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/846/3da/3326b55a4993654efe8428f9ad.jpg><p>You are correct but should just say you don't want her there. Asking her to get rid of the dog says that anyway.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/c45/b45/a6fccc5930afc20dca89e59d9c.jpg><p>I don’t hear anyone asking why this child is not speaking to her own mother. Her mother is obviously NOT DEAD! She is choosing NOT to live at her home, with the parent who obviously has parental custody of her. Sounds like a spoiled brat who wants to move somewhere where she thinks she can live free and act like an adult! I have lots of friends who had to leave their pets at home or rehouse them because they were not allowed where they moved or they just couldn’t afford the pet fees. And how unfair is it to a pet to have to live somewhere with someone who is allergic to you and they resent your being in their home?!</p><p><strong>Thank you, Emily, for trusting&nbsp;us with your story. The situation is&nbsp;indeed difficult, especially with a&nbsp;teenager adjusting to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new family dynamic. We&nbsp;hope that our advice will be&nbsp;helpful for you.</strong></p><p><h2>Communicate clearly.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/474/473/2b889054dc8c1de49598bccb01.jpg><p>Sit down with your stepdaughter and have an open, honest conversation about the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>rules</a> and why they are important. Explain that these rules are not meant to be punitive, but to ensure fairness and maintain order in the household. Listen to her concerns and be open to discussing possible adjustments that could make her feel more comfortable without compromising your family’s needs.</p><p><h2>Seek common ground.</h2></p><p>Find areas where you and your stepdaughter can agree. For example, you could be&nbsp;flexible with the rules, like letting her ease into the <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>chores</a> over time or&nbsp;finding a&nbsp;solution for her dog if&nbsp;bringing it&nbsp;isn’t possible. Compromising can reduce tension and show that you’re willing to&nbsp;work together to&nbsp;make things work.</p><p><h2>Consider involving a&nbsp;counselor.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/668/de8/fc1c475a7ea82c3f904ebf7eed.jpg><p>Consider bringing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;family <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>counselor</a> or&nbsp;mediator if&nbsp;talking things through remains difficult. A&nbsp;neutral person can help guide a&nbsp;productive discussion between you, your husband, and your stepdaughter, making sure everyone’s concerns are listened to&nbsp;and handled fairly.</p><p><h2>Create a&nbsp;plan.</h2></p><p>Recognize that moving in&nbsp;can be&nbsp;a&nbsp;significant <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>adjustment</a> for a&nbsp;teenager. Develop a&nbsp;transition plan that includes gradual integration into the household rules and responsibilities. This approach can help her adapt more smoothly and feel more included in&nbsp;the family dynamics.</p><p><h2>Reaffirm your support.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/ca4/613/5900c65418a33e4fcca38f7dbb.jpg><p>The biggest mistake she made was not talking this over with her husband beforehand and coming to a mutually agreed upon set of rules and then having h be the one to present those rules to his daughter.</p><p>Making up the rules on her own and going to the daughter on her own to tell her the rules she decided upon was a mistake.</p><p>Doing things the way she did was bound to create resentment from the daughter since she is her stepmother and not her actual mother (step parents disciplining or making rules for their step children rarely goes well); as well as from her husband for not including him in the decision making process for the rules for his child.</p><p>While her rules may have been reasonable, she pretty much went about it in the worst way possible.</p><p>Make sure your stepdaughter knows that, despite the rules, you <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>care</a> about her and want her to&nbsp;feel welcomed and valued in&nbsp;the family. Spend quality time with her and show support in&nbsp;ways that help build trust and strengthen your relationship. This will help her feel loved and reduce feelings of&nbsp;resentment or&nbsp;rejection.</p><p>Relationships with in-laws can also be difficult, especially when you have different views on important subjects. When a caring grandmother discovered that her daughter-in-law was only bathing the children <a href=#>twice a week</a>, she couldn’t help but step in. Little did she expect that her actions would lead to family conflict and drama.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLZuvsSfrKydXam8brjErWSmsV2dwrSuwKebrGWUlsKotNOeqWakmauybsPIrZ9mraNiwq%2B4xKyqZquYmnqnu8ulprCrXaLGbr7UpZysZWhmhneFkGg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fi-refuse-to-let-my-husbands-daughter-live-with-us-unless-she-follows-my-rules-819691.html&text=I%20Refuse%20to%20Let%20My%20Husbands%20Daughter%20Live%20With%20Us%20Unless%20She%20Follows%20My%20Rules&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fi-refuse-to-let-my-husbands-daughter-live-with-us-unless-she-follows-my-rules-819691.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fi-refuse-to-let-my-husbands-daughter-live-with-us-unless-she-follows-my-rules-819691.html&title=I%20Refuse%20to%20Let%20My%20Husbands%20Daughter%20Live%20With%20Us%20Unless%20She%20Follows%20My%20Rules" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fi-refuse-to-let-my-husbands-daughter-live-with-us-unless-she-follows-my-rules-819691.html&title=I%20Refuse%20to%20Let%20My%20Husbands%20Daughter%20Live%20With%20Us%20Unless%20She%20Follows%20My%20Rules" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fi-refuse-to-let-my-husbands-daughter-live-with-us-unless-she-follows-my-rules-819691.html&title=I%20Refuse%20to%20Let%20My%20Husbands%20Daughter%20Live%20With%20Us%20Unless%20She%20Follows%20My%20Rules" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fi-refuse-to-let-my-husbands-daughter-live-with-us-unless-she-follows-my-rules-819691.html&description=I%20Refuse%20to%20Let%20My%20Husbands%20Daughter%20Live%20With%20Us%20Unless%20She%20Follows%20My%20Rules" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./kizz-daniels-mysterious-twitter-post-sparks-marriage-breakup-rumours.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Kizz Daniel's mysterious Twitter post sparks marriage breakup rumours">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./dungeons-and-dragons-bradley-cooper-cameo-1235549391.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="How Dungeons &amp;amp; Dragons: Honor Among Thieves Landed That Surprise Cameo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
