Cruise, his mother, and his 3&nbsp;sisters, Lee Anne, Marian, and Catherine, were left to&nbsp;fend for themselves after their parents’ <a href=# title=divorce data-link=tag>divorce</a>. Following the split, his father remarried, leaving Cruise with a&nbsp;lot of&nbsp;unresolved anger and confusion as&nbsp;he&nbsp;struggled to&nbsp;comprehend why his father had abandoned them. The actor never saw his father again after the divorce.</p><p>Pfeiffer eventually left and moved with her children to&nbsp;a&nbsp;new city and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>wedded</a> her second spouse. And to&nbsp;provide for her children, the devoted mom <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>worked</a> 3&nbsp;part-time jobs.

Despite his young age, he&nbsp;took his responsibilities to&nbsp;care for his mother and 3&nbsp;sisters seriously. While most boys his age might prioritize their own interests, Tom remained close to&nbsp;his mother and <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>spent</a> all his income on&nbsp;providing for his family.</p><p><h2>Putting his dream on&nbsp;hold for his family</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b0b/24a/8830b25d61a43711ca39b0aa06.jpg><p>Although he&nbsp;had a&nbsp;passion for acting and had previously imitated comedians and cartoon characters, Tom put his dreams on&nbsp;hold to&nbsp;help his family. However, he&nbsp;eventually auditioned for and won his first role in&nbsp;his high school’s theater program, which reignited his passion for acting.
