But they became the focus of a partisan backlash after the brand, owned by Mars Inc., made a number of stylistic tweaks to its cast of “spokescandies” last year to be more inclusive. Right-wing commentators began criticizing the campaign, with Fox News host Tucker Carlson devoting time during multiple segments to decry the popular candy as “Woke M&M’s.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Now the brand is moving in a new direction, the company said in an announcement posted on social media. The “spokescandies” are on “an indefinite pause” and actress Maya Rudolph will become the new face of M&M’s—someone the brand said “America can agree on.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But the decision to put a temporary pause on the iconic mascots drew its own share of criticism from fans and branding experts alike. Some also <a href=# rel=noopener>questioned</a> whether it had all been an elaborate stunt to capitalize on a low-stakes internet controversy.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“What M&M’s is showing is that it’s going to back down from what it stands for if it receives a lot of negative criticism,” says Deb Gabor, the CEO of Sol Marketing, a branding agency. “It’s becoming increasingly important to people that they know what brands stand for when they throw down their support.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The M&M’s controversy could serve as a lesson for other brands.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There’s an old saying—if it ain’t broke, don’t fix it,” says Steven Fink, a crisis consultant and author of <i>Crisis Communications: The Definitive Guide to Managing the Message. </i>“I suggest they make it a permanent pause. They should go back to doing whatever they were doing before because nobody was paying any attention to it until they started this nonsense—unless the new characters had increased their sales.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s how we got here.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">‘Even A Candy’s Shoes Can Be Polarizing’</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As it turns out, not everyone can agree on what kind of shoes an M&M cartoon character should wear.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mm-characters.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In January 2022, the brand replaced the green M&M’s knee-high boots with flats and swapped the brown M&M’s stilettos for lower heels. It also announced that the orange M&M would embrace his anxiety; he would even start tying his shoelaces—moves many celebrated as more progressive.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">But others saw the revamp as an affront.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“M&M’s will not be satisfied until every last cartoon character is deeply unappealing and totally androgynous until the moment when you wouldn’t want to have a drink with any one of them,” <a href=# rel=noopener>Carlson remarked</a> on Fox. “That’s the goal. When you’re totally turned off, we’ve achieved equity. They’ve won.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">M&M’s addressed the cosmetic tweaks in <a href=# rel=noopener>a statement on Monday</a>, telling fans it hadn’t expected people to even notice the initial changes. “We definitely didn’t think it would break the internet,” the brand said. “But now we get it—even a candy’s shoes can be polarizing.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">‘Uplifting and Empowering Women’</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The chocolate candies generated more buzz in right-wing circles this month after M&M’s introduced a new purple character to its roster and added it to a limited edition all-female character branded pack intended to “celebrate women everywhere who are flipping the status quote.” Mars, Inc. said that a portion of profits would go to organizations that are “uplifting and empowering women,” including She Is The Music and We Are Moving the Needle, two nonprofit organizations that support women in the music industry.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“Woke M&M’s have returned,” Carlson declared on his show in mid-January. “The green M&M’s got her boots back but apparently is now a lesbian, maybe, and there is also a plus-sized, obese purple M&M. So we’re going to cover that, of course. Because that’s what we do.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/api.time.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/01/mm-characters-2.jpg><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mars, Inc. has not specified the sexual orientation of the green M&M, while the purple M&M appears to be the shape of its peanut flavored candies, which are typically larger, like the original yellow character.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">More than 20,000 people have signed an online petition to “<a href=# rel=noopener>keep the green M&M sexy</a>.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Other right-wing figures weighed in on the drama, too. One even claimed that the brand’s attempt at inclusivity emboldens China.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“If this is what you need for validation, an M&M that is the color that you think is associated with feminism, then I’m worried about you,” Fox News anchor Martha MacCallum <a href=# rel=noopener>said earlier this month.</a> “I think that makes China say, ‘Oh, good, keep focusing on that. Keep focusing on giving people their own color M&M’s while we take over all of the mineral deposits in the entire world.’”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“When I eat a bag of M&M’s, do I wonder which color and shape best represents my identity? No, because it’s f—ing chocolate,” Fox News host Greg Gutfeld said in January 2022. “If you really truly want to make an M&M feel like they belong, you probably shouldn’t be eating them. I mean, what kind of message does it send to children when you devour these non-binary bonbons?”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">M&M’s Response</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In response, the brand said on Monday that the polarized reaction to the rebrand was “the last thing M&M’s wanted,” emphasizing its focus on bringing people together. “Therefore, we have decided to take an indefinite pause from the spokescandies.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The mascots had been used in the brand’s advertising campaigns since 1954. Older M&M’s commercials featured Red and Yellow, representing regular and peanut M&M’s. New characters and colors joined the crew in the 1990s.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Rudolph, the new M&M spokesperson, will represent the brand in a Super Bowl ad on Feb. 12, the actress announced on Monday’s TODAY Show.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“There are other ways to get attention that are more long term and aligned with the brand,” Gabor says. “This doesn’t feel like a stunt. It feels like they stepped in something they didn’t like, and they backtracked.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">“It’s a really hard time to be a brand and navigate these things,” Gabor added. “We have a very, very polarized society … And I always tell our clients that actions speak louder than marketing.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Carlson touched on the subject again during his show Monday night, after the U-turn was announced. “Well the geniuses at the Mars Corporation imagine you might want to be lectured about sexual politics while you eat their chocolate candies. It turns out a lot of people didn’t want that, they just wanted the snack,” he said.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Mars, Inc. did not immediately respond to a request for a comment.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvamRugnZ9jqZkpmWTlrulxYymmKybn6nAbq%2FUpauuqpVixKK%2B0mg%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fm-m-candy-mascots-culture-wars.html&text=Why%20M%26amp%3bMs%20Dropped%20Their%20Woke%20Mascots&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fm-m-candy-mascots-culture-wars.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fm-m-candy-mascots-culture-wars.html&title=Why%20M%26amp%3bMs%20Dropped%20Their%20Woke%20Mascots" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fm-m-candy-mascots-culture-wars.html&title=Why%20M%26amp%3bMs%20Dropped%20Their%20Woke%20Mascots" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fm-m-candy-mascots-culture-wars.html&title=Why%20M%26amp%3bMs%20Dropped%20Their%20Woke%20Mascots" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fm-m-candy-mascots-culture-wars.html&description=Why%20M%26amp%3bMs%20Dropped%20Their%20Woke%20Mascots" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./americas-got-talent-comedian-apologizes-after-prank-gone-wrong.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="'America's Got Talent' Comedian Apologizes After Prank Gone Wrong">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./le-syndicat-mixte-paris-metropole-voit-officiellement-le-jour.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Le syndicat mixte Paris Mtropole voit officiellement le jour">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
