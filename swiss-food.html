And with literally hundreds of types to choose from, trying all the cheese is indeed a must!</p><p>But Swiss cuisine has even more to offer. Nestled between the borders of<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Germany, France and Italy</a>, Switzerland combines the culinary<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> heritage</a> of all three countries into something entirely its own.</p><p>Whether you prefer savory or sweet, healthy or heavy, Swiss restaurants will never leave you unsatisfied. Just as when exploring<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> French food</a>, it can be a bit overwhelming to figure out where to start, so we’ve put together a list of our favorite traditional Swiss foods.</p><p>Our advice? Make sure to try as many of them as you can.<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> En Guete</a>!</p><li><a href=#>Zürcher Geschnetzeltes</a></li><li><a href=#>Polenta</a></li><li><a href=#>Tartiflette</a></li><li><a href=#>Landjäger</a></li><li><a href=#>Roasted flour soup</a></li><li><a href=#>Rösti</a></li><li><a href=#>Cheese fondue</a></li><li><a href=#>Raclette</a></li><li><a href=#>Leckerli</a></li><li><a href=#>Vacherin Mont D’Or</a></li><li><a href=#>Bircherműesli</a></li><li><a href=#>Äplermagronen</a></li><li><a href=#>Malakoff</a></li><li><a href=#>Saffron risotto</a></li><li><a href=#>Riz Casimir</a></li><li><a href=#>Swiss chocolate</a></li><li><a href=#>Swiss cheese</a></li><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=1.-Zürcher-Geschnetzeltes>1. Zürcher Geschnetzeltes</h2><p>Also known as Zurich Ragout, Zürcher Geschnetzeltes combines the traditional Germanic flavors of lemon zest and parsley with mushrooms in a white-wine sauce.</p><p>Served with rösti (a classic Swiss potato dish, which we’ll revisit in a moment) and white wine, this veal-based delicacy is an absolute staple of Swiss cuisine.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=2.-Polenta>2. Polenta</h2><p>Like many other celebrated dishes around the world, polenta was once considered peasant food. But this humble (and hearty) dish of slow-cooked corn meal has shed its modest reputation and established itself as a staple in Switzerland and Italy.</p><p>Part of that owes to its versatility; polenta can be eaten hot and cold and with sweet or savory toppings. Our tip: Try it with braised beef!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=3.-Tartiflette>3. Tartiflette</h2><p>Many traditional Swiss dishes revolve around the famous Swiss cheeses, and tartiflette is no exception. Tartiflette combines local Reblochon cheese with potatoes, bacon and caramelized onions.</p><p>Given the hearty nature of this combination, it comes as no surprise that tartiflette is popular in ski resorts across Switzerland.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=4.-Landjäger>4. Landjäger</h2><p>Preparing for a hike around the Swiss mountains? Make sure you pack yourself some good snacks — including landjäger.</p><p>The meat and mixed spices in these dried sausages will surely provide you with the energy to climb any mountain.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=5.-Roasted-flour-soup>5. Roasted flour soup</h2><p>According to the legend, roasted flour soup was created when a distracted cook left flour cooking in a pot until it browned. The result? One of Basel’s finest food exports.</p><p>As the name suggests, this soup is made from roasted flour combined with butter, onion, beef stock and Gruyère, resulting in creamy Swiss deliciousness.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=6.-Rösti>6. Rösti</h2><p>If you like potatoes, you will absolutely love rösti. One of the most famous Swiss dishes, it’s made from potatoes grated and pan-fried into golden brown pieces. Rösti’s impressive versatility means that it can be combined with many other Swiss foods.</p><p>Try it with your Zürcher Geschnetzeltes, and you’ll never want to leave Switzerland again!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=7.-Cheese-fondue>7. Cheese fondue</h2><p>Although cheese can absolutely not be avoided when in Switzerland, fondue brings it to the next level: full-bodied cheese melted in a pot over an open flame. Served with bread cubes and other foods for dipping, this simple but decadent classic is an absolute must-try!</p><p>This fondue is best paired with a dry white wine or hot tea, and sometimes even with a shot of kirsch.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=8.-Raclette>8. Raclette</h2><p>Raclette is a world-renowned Swiss cheese that lends its name to this (similarly world-renowned) dish. Similar to fondue, Raclette combines melted cheese with pretty much any other food of your choice.</p><p>The cheese goes into a small pan and is heated in a special Raclette grill. Vegetables or meats can be added to the grill, too, though the cheese has the spotlight all to itself in the pan. Raclette is best enjoyed with a group of friends over the course of several hours, so plan accordingly.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=9.-Leckerli>9. Leckerli</h2><p>Any meal is improved by a delicious dessert at the end, and Leckerli offers you just that. These gingerbread-spiced cookies are topped with chocolate and make for a classic treat around Christmas Time.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=10.-Vacherin-Mont-D’Or>10. Vacherin Mont D’Or</h2><p>Yet another cheese-based Swiss specialty to sample, Vacherin Mont D’Or is flavored with white wine and garlic. It’s a seasonal classic, typically eaten in the winter months between September and April.&nbsp;</p><p>Vacherin Fribourgeois, derived from the French term “Vacherin of Fribourg,” is a Swiss semi-hard cheese crafted from thermised milk. It holds Swiss AOC status and is manufactured in the canton of Fribourg.</p><p>Known for its slightly acidic and resinous flavor reminiscent of Italian Fontina, its intensity varies with age and type. Additionally, it serves as a fundamental ingredient, imparting distinctive character to fondues depending on the recipe.</p><p><h2 class=headline>Learn languages at your pace</h2></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=11.-Bircherműsli>11. Bircherműsli</h2><p>Müsli is a breakfast staple in many households around the world, but did you know that it was invented in Switzerland?</p><p>Bichermüsli combines flaked oats, fruit, and nuts with milk or yogurt. It may seem simple, but one bowl of this stuff provides the energy you need for a whole day of exploring Switzerland.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=12.-Äplermagronen>12. Äplermagronen</h2><p>What macaroni and cheese is for Americans, Äplermagronen is for the Swiss. Translated to Alpine macaroni, Äplermagronen is exactly that: Pasta topped with cheese, onions, and boiled potatoes.</p><p>Frequently, Älplermagronen comes with a spoonful of applesauce alongside, imparting a hint of sweetness that perfectly complements the robust dish.</p><p>Many variations exist around Switzerland, so don’t hesitate to try them at<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> different places</a>!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=13.-Malakoff>13. Malakoff</h2><p>If you’re the type to start off your meal of Swiss cheese with some Swiss cheese, Malakoff should check all your boxes.</p><p>These fried cheese balls are found in abundance around Lake Geneva, and they’re typically is usually eaten as a starter combined with pickles and mustard as a starter.&nbsp;</p><p>Its origins trace back to Swiss mercenaries who participated in the Crimean War alongside French-British forces against Russia. Named after the pivotal battle of Malakoff, which led to the fall of Sevastopol and the end of the conflict, this Swiss cheese bread has become synonymous with the region.</p><p>Traditionally served as a first course, Malakoff is accompanied by cornichons, pickled onions, and mustard, with wine serving as its ideal pairing.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=14.-Saffron-risotto>14. Saffron risotto</h2><p>Saffron risotto, a culinary masterpiece originating from the Swiss canton of Ticino, beautifully embodies the fusion of Italian influence and Swiss refinement within the region’s cuisine.</p><p>Initially known as Risotto alla Milanese in Italy, this dish has been embraced and adapted by the Swiss, holding a prestigious position in Ticino’s culinary tradition.</p><p>It is often served with a generous sprinkle of Parmesan cheese and it has a creamy smooth texture, and infused with the exotic essence of saffron.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=15.-Riz-Casimir>15. Riz Casimir</h2><p>Riz Casimir is a culinary creation seamlessly marrying Swiss precision with the exotic essence of curry and tropical fruits.</p><p>Originating from the inventive kitchens of Swiss restaurant chain Mövenpick in the 1950s, Riz Casimir epitomizes a culinary era marked by burgeoning global influences. This dish offers a delightful fusion of flavors, showcasing tender chicken pieces enveloped in a creamy, mild curry sauce, delicately placed atop a bed of fluffy white rice.</p><p>Fragrant chunks of pineapple, banana, and occasionally cherries or peaches adorn the curry, imparting a burst of sweetness.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=16.-Swiss-Chocolate>16. Swiss Chocolate</h2><p>When it comes to indulgently smooth and exquisitely rich confections, Swiss chocolate unquestionably ranks among the world’s finest.</p><p>Swiss chocolatiers have played a pivotal role in pioneering innovations that have shaped the chocolate industry, including Daniel Peter’s creation of milk chocolate and Rodolphe Lindt’s development of the conching process, which imparts chocolate with its irresistibly smooth consistency.</p><p>Characterized by its high cocoa content, premium whole milk powder, and unmatched creamy texture, Swiss chocolate reflects the adherence to strict quality standards and the utilization of time-honored techniques refined over generations.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading id=17.-Swiss-cheese-in-all-its-glory>17. Swiss cheese in all its glory</h2><p>Cheese and more is what you can expect when coming to Switzerland, which probably explains why so many people visit this small country in the Alps.</p><p>Initially, cheese makers considered the holes formed by carbon dioxide in the final stages of cheese production a flaw and attempted to prevent them by pressing the cheese. However, today, the holes have become a distinctive feature of Swiss cheese.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Emmental</h3><p>Within the array of Swiss cheeses, Emmental, often synonymous with “Swiss cheese” internationally, stands out as one of the most widely recognized. It originated in west central Switzerland—a region called Emmental. Distinguished by its large, iconic holes or “eyes,” Emmental boasts a subtly sweet, nutty flavor and a firm, velvety texture.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Gruyère</h3><p>Gruyère, another cherished Swiss cheese, is renowned for its luscious, creamy consistency and versatile flavor profile that matures with time. Then, there’s Appenzeller, a semi-hard cheese imbued with a secret herbal brine, imparting a unique tanginess.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Tête de Moine</h3><p>Tête de Moine is a fantastic addition to any cheese board, boasting bold flavors and a versatile texture that lends itself well to cooking.</p><p>Experiment by melting it over roasted fingerling potatoes, incorporating it into a warm cream and herb sauce for gnocchi, or using it as a topping for grilled burgers.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Sbrinz – hard, full fat cheese made of raw milk</h3><p>Sbrinz stands as one of the most ancient European cheeses, originating from Central Switzerland. This exceptionally hard cheese is frequently grated in Swiss culinary traditions.</p><p>Sbrinz is an extra-hard, full-fat cheese, boasting a fat content of approximately 40% to 45% when dry. To attain its distinctive flavor, Sbrinz requires a minimum of 16 months of ripening before it can be marketed as such, with its full richness emerging after around 24–30 months of storage.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Baby Swiss</h3><p>Baby Swiss, characterized by its petite perforations and gentle flavor, is crafted from whole milk. Developed in the mid-1960s near Charm, Ohio, it originated from the Guggisberg Cheese Company, under the ownership of Alfred Guggisberg and is produced in smaller wheels with smaller holes than most other cheeses.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>Appenzeller cheese</h3><p>Appenzeller cheese is a hard cow’s-milk cheese originating from the Appenzellerland region in northeast Switzerland, produced in the cantons of Appenzell Innerrhoden and Appenzell Ausserrhoden.</p><p>With a history dating back at least 700 years, its manufacturing process has evolved, with about 75 dairies each using a unique recipe for the brine wash applied during curing. This herbal brine, sometimes infused with wine or cider, enhances flavor and aids in rind formation.</p><p>One thing is for sure: Switzerland will not leave you hungry — or craving dairy, for that matter. And if you’re into pairing meals with local wines, few countries do it better.</p><p>So pour a glass, melt some cheese and enjoy the full Swiss experience, as you are practicing your<a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener"> Swiss French</a> or exploring the stunning nature of this country!</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><strong>FAQs</strong></h2><p>In this section, let’s explore the most frequently asked questions about Swiss cuisine and Swiss cheese</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What is the national dish of Switzerland?</h3><p>The national dish of Switzerland is fondue, a delightful concoction of melted cheese served with bread for dipping.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the best Swiss cheeses to eat in Switzerland?</h3><p>Some of the best Swiss cheeses to enjoy in Switzerland include Emmental, Gruyère, Appenzeller, and Vacherin Mont d’Or.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading>What are the typical sweets in Basel?</h3><p>Typical sweets in Basel include “Basler Leckerli,” honey and almond biscuits, and “Chriesibrötli,” a cherry-filled pastry.</p><p>Basler Brunsli, a staple during the Christmas season across Switzerland, also originated in Basel.
