Instead of <a href=#>singing two surprise songs</a> that aren’t on the three-and-a-half-hour-long show’s expansive setlist toward the end of the performance, she began doing mashups of those surprise songs.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The first time around, she combined two 1989 (Taylor’s Version) songs: “Is It Over Now?” and “Out of the Woods.” Following a perhaps unsurprisingly positive reception, the singer has continued to do mashups while touring throughout Brazil, Japan, Australia, and Singapore.&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">As of March 14, the box-office juggernaut <a href=#>Eras Tour concert film</a> is available to stream on Disney+. This version includes a number of songs that didn’t appear in the film's theatrical release or its VOD release in December, including “Cardigan,” “Maroon,” “Death By a Thousand Cuts,” “You Are In Love,” and “I Can See You.”</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Here’s a guide to all of the mashups Swift has done of her surprise songs.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Is It Over Now?” and “Out of the Woods” from </strong><strong>1989 (Taylor’s Version)</strong></h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>Taylor Swift performing an acoustic Out of the Woods and Is It Over Now? mash-up is so important.</p><p>My two favorite 1989 era songs. 😭🙌<a href=#>pic.twitter.com/gaKlyRX3PA</a></p>— Alex Goldschmidt (@alexandergold) <a href=#>November 12, 2023</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In the first mashup to be presented as one of Swift’s surprise songs, the pop star chose two songs from her latest re-release, 1989 (Taylor’s Version). The album had just come out a few weeks prior, and she decided to surprise the audience with one of the new vault tracks and a fan favorite—both of which are rumored to be about her <a href=#>former relationship with singer Harry Styles</a>. Theories from fans point to the same lyrics in each song that seem to hint at a snowmobile accident the two got into in 2012.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Getaway Car”/ “August”/ and “Other Side of the Door”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At her stop in Melbourne, Australia, on Feb. 17, Swift played “Getaway Car” off her 2017 album, Reputation (the next album that fans are theorizing will be released as part of her re-recording project). Swift first played the song in May during her New Jersey stop, where she brought out her collaborator, Jack Antonoff. The mashup took an interesting turn when she included the Folklore cut “August,” which is already on the original setlist, and then took another turn to include a song from Fearless (Taylor’s Version) called “Other Side of the Door.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Come Back… Be Here” and “Daylight”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift busted out a deep cut from her Red (Taylor’s Version) album called “Come Back… Be Here” and mashed it up with “Daylight,” a song off of Lover—the first album in her discography that she retained the masters to when she signed her new record deal with Republic Records in 2018. It was during this third Melbourne show that she said she might repeat some surprise songs as the tour continues. “I want to be as creative as possible with the acoustic set moving forward, and I don’t want to limit anything or say, ‘Oh if I played this song, I can’t play it again,’” she <a href=#>said at the show</a>. “So, from now on, I don’t want to take any paint colors out of the paintbox [or] tools out of the toolbox.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“White Horse” and “Coney Island”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Inclement weather during the Eras Tour’s first stop in in Sydney, Australia made it so Swift’s opener, Sabrina Carpenter, could not perform her set. Later, Swift brought out Carpenter to do a duet mashup of “White Horse” from Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and “Coney Island” from Evermore. Carpenter took to Instagram to describe the moment she shared with Swift onstage. “9-year-old Sabrina singing white horse would never see this sh-t coming,” she wrote in the caption of the post.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Should’ve Said No” and “You’re Not Sorry”/ “Peace” and “New Year’s Day”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The second Sydney night got two surprise song mashups. Swift performed “Should’ve Said No” from her debut self-titled album and mixed it with “You’re Not Sorry” from Fearless (Taylor’s Version). The second set of surprise songs was “Peace” from Evermore and “New Year’s Day” from Reputation—which her fans believe will be the next re-release.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Is It Over Now?” (Again) and “I Wish You Would/ “Haunted and “Exile”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift stuck to her word and repeated a surprise song. She combined ”Is It Over Now?” with a different 1989 (Taylor’s Version) track, “I Wish You Would.” For the second portion of the surprise songs section, she performed the rock-heavy cut “Haunted” from Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) and her Bon Iver collaboration, “Exile” from Folklore.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift’s “Exile” performance led to a woman going viral after she posted her emotional reaction to hearing the song live, as she sat outside of the stadium with her friends. Though she became the butt of a joke, she told <a href=#>Rolling Stone</a>, she said she was in on it. “I understand why people are laughing at it. I laughed at the video myself once I first watched it back,” she said.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Forever & Always” and “Maroon”/ “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve” and “Ivy”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The singer treated her fans to another two mashups for her final night in Sydney with the Fearless (Taylor’s Version) track “Forever & Always” and “Maroon” from Midnights. However, that wasn’t the only Midnights song she did. Later, the pop star mixed “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve” with “Ivy” from Evermore.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Mine” and “Starlight”/ “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever” and “Dress”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The singer had a couple of days off before returning to the stage for a few dates in Singapore. At the first show on this leg, she sang a fan-favorite from Speak Now (Taylor’s Version): “Mine” and combined it with “Starlight” from Red (Taylor’s Version). That same night, she busted out the song she collaborated with Zayn Malik on the 50 Shades Darker soundtrack, “I Don’t Wanna Live Forever,” and incorporated her Reputation song, “Dress,” into the mashup.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Long Story Short” and “The Story of Us”/ “Clean” and “Evermore”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Another two mashup night came at the second show in Singapore. Swift decided to combine “Long Story Short” from Evermore with “The Story of Us” from Speak Now (Taylor’s Version).&nbsp;</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Before Swift got into the second mashup on the night (which was “Clean” from 1989 (Taylor’s Version) and the title track from Evermore), she shared “the final edition” of her forthcoming 11th studio album, The Tortured Poets Department. She said, “It’s the final cover … [and] there’s a song called "The Black Dog." I can’t wait for you to hear it, and I just appreciate the enthusiasm.” She posted the cover to Instagram.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Foolish One” and “Tell Me Why”/ “This Love” and “Call It What You Want”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">The third Singapore night featured two mashups: the vault track “Foolish One” from Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) and “Tell Me Why” from Fearless (Taylor’s Version). The second mashup was the 1989 (Taylor’s Version) song “This Love” and “Call It What You Want” from Reputation.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Death by a Thousand Cuts” and “Babe”/ “Fifteen” and “You’re On Your Own Kid”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift’s fourth Singapore show featured some of her most emotional songs. She sang Lover’s “Death By a Thousand Cuts” and “Babe” from Red (Taylor’s Version). On piano, the singer performed “Fifteen” from Fearless (Taylor’s Version) and the most played surprise song, “You’re On Your Own Kid,” which she’s played five times, <a href=#>according to Us Weekly</a>.&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Sparks Fly” and “Gold Rush”/ “False God” and “Slut!”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During another two mashup nights, Swift performed “Sparks Fly,” the second song on Speak Now (Taylor’s Version), and “Gold Rush” off of Evermore on the guitar. The pop star then took to the piano to sing “False God” and “Slut!” to close out the surprise songs portion of the show.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Tim McGraw” and “Cowboy Like Me”/ “Mirrorball” and “Epiphany”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At her last show on the Singapore leg, Swift opted for yet another two-mashup night. This was her last show before the tour picked up again in May in Europe. For the acoustic portion of the set, the singer did “Tim McGraw” from her self-titled debut album and “Cowboy Like Me,” a cut off of Evermore. She closed out the surprise songs portion on the piano and delivered a somber performance of two Folklore songs, “Mirrorball” and “Epiphany.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><br>"The Alchemy" and "Treacherous" / "Begin Again" and "Paris"</h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On the fourth and final night of her Paris tour dates on May 12, Swift treated her fans to a mashup of “The Alchemy,” a new song from her recently released album The Tortured Poets Department, and “Treacherous,” a song from Red that she included in her surprise songs set in April 2023. “The Alchemy” is rumored to be about Swift's boyfriend, Travis Kelce, the Kansas City Chiefs’ tight end. Kelce and Swift's friends Gigi Hadid and Bradley Cooper were spotted on the final night of the four Paris dates.</p><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">When she performed the second half of the surprise song set, she played “Begin Again” from her Red album and “Paris,” a cut off Midnights. She also sang “Paris” during her first night in the city.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“I Think He Knows” and “Gorgeous”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">After a short hiatus following her Paris dates, Swift returned to the stage in Stockholm, Sweden, for three nights at the Friends Arena. During the surprise portion of the night, she took fans back to her Lover and Reputation days. She performed a mashup of her songs “I Think He Knows” and “Gorgeous.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Say Don’t Go,” “Welcome to New York,” and “Clean”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">In celebration of her 89th show, Swift decided to do a triple mashup of songs from her 1989 (Taylor’s Version) album. She did two songs off the original album, “Wellcome to New York” and “Clean,” and a vault track, “Say Don’t Go.” This was her first time ever doing a triple mashup.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Message in a Bottle”/ “How You Get the Girl” and “New Romantics”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">For her last night in Sweden, Swift did yet another three-song mashup in honor of her close friend and former collaborator, Max Martin, who was in the audience. At the show, she performed “Message in a Bottle” from Red (Taylor’s Version) and two tracks from 1989 (Taylor’s Version), “How You Get the Girl” and “New Romantics,” all songs where Martin has writing credits.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Come Back, Be Here,” “The Way I Loved You,” and “The Other Side of the Door”/ “Fresh Out the Slammer,” and “High Infidelity”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On her first of two nights in Lisbon, Portugal, Swift performed two songs from Fearless (Taylor’s Version): “The Way I Loved You,” which she performed for the first time on this tour, and “The Other Side of the Door.” She combined those two songs with “Come Back, Be Here” from Red (Taylor’s Version). For the piano section of the surprise songs, she mashed up “Fresh Out the Slammer” and “High Infidelity.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“The Tortured Poets Department” and “Now That We Don’t Talk”/ “You’re On Your Own Kid” and “Long Live”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On night two in Lisbon, Swift surprised fans with another first: the title track from The Tortured Poets Department, a song she had yet to sing on tour, mashed with the 1989 (Taylor’s Version) vault track, “Now That We Don’t Talk.” As she sat behind the piano, Swift then played a mashup of “You’re On Your Own Kid” from Midnights and “Long Live” from Speak Now (Taylor’s Version).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Sparks Fly” and “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)”/ “I Look in People’s Windows” and “Snow on the Beach”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Following two shows in Portugal, Swift made her way over to Madrid, Spain, and played two shows there. On night one, she played the Speak Now (Taylor’s Version) track, “Sparks Fly” and mixed that with “I Can Fix Him (No Really I Can)” for the first part of the surprise songs mashup section. For the second part, she did “I Look In People’s Windows” with her Lana Del Rey collab from Midnights, “Snow on the Beach.” Her fans thought she was going to bring Lana out and Swift had to <a href=#>quell the excitement by telling</a> her fans, “It’s just me guys, sorry!”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Our Song” and “Jump Then Fall”</strong></h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>“Especially Spain, you guys have supported me since the VERY beginning and I know that.” - Taylor’s opening speech to singing Debut “Our Song” x Fearless “Jump Then Fall” mashup as the first surprise song! 🥹 <a href=#>#MadridTStheErasTour</a><br><a href=#>pic.twitter.com/y2YUoqBthd</a></p>— Taylor Swift Updates (@SwiftNYC) <a href=#>May 30, 2024</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">During her second night in Spain, she did one of her early singles, “Our Song” from her debut self-titled album, and mashed it up with “Jump Then Fall” from Fearless (Taylor’s Version).&nbsp;</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“The Prophecy” and “Long Story Short”/ “Fifteen” and “You’re On Your Own Kid”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift then made her way north to France for two nights in Lyon. She debuted another song off The Tortured Poets Department, “The Prophecy,” and combined that with “Long Story Short” from Evermore. She then took the piano to do “You’re On Your Own Kid” again and mashed it up with “Fifteen” from Fearless (Taylor’s Version).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“Glitch” and “Everything Has Changed”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">On her second night in France, Swift did a track off of the 3 AM version of Midnights, “Glitch” and combined it with the Ed Sheeran duet song, “Everything Has Changed” from Red (Taylor’s Version).</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>"Would've, Could've, Should've" and "I Know Places"/ "'Tis the Damn Season" and "Daylight"</strong></h2><p lang=en dir=ltr>🚨| Full video of Taylor Swift performing - mashup of "Would've Could've Should've" and "I Know Places" at today's show including her stopping singing for a fan to get help and her hand cramping! <a href=#>#EdinburghTSTheErasTour</a></p><p><a href=#>https://t.co/kjspdFalAs</a></p>— The Eras Tour (@tswifterastour) <a href=#>June 7, 2024</a><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">Swift took the Eras tour to Edinburgh, Scotland, and for the guitar portion of the surprise songs section of the show, she performed a mashup of “Would’ve, Could’ve, Should’ve” and “I Know Places.” She stopped the performance midway through when a fan began asking for help. Swift told security that someone needed help and pointed at them with her guitar as she continued playing. “She’s right there. I’m just gonna keep playing until somebody helps them, I’m gonna be singing this song. Just let me know.

For the second half of the surprise song section, she busted out a song she’s never performed live: a cut from Lover, “All the Girls You Loved Before,” and for the first time ever, Swift performed “Crazier” from the Hannah Montana movie soundtrack. She told fans, “You get extra credit points if you know this next song at all because it is really, really old.”</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline"><strong>“It’s Nice to Have a Friend” and “Dorothea” / "Haunted” and “Exile”</strong></h2><p class="self-baseline px-0 font-pt-serif text-17px leading-7 tracking-0.5px">At her most recent show, the last night in Edinburgh, Swift performed the Lover track, “It’s Nice to Have a Friend” and put it together with “Dorothea” from Evermore. She also performed a mashup of “Haunted” off of Speak Now and “Exile” from Folklore, a mashup she already did at her show in Sydney, in February.</p><h2 class="text-2xl font-bold tracking-0.5px font-zilla-slab self-baseline">More From TIME</h2><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmismaKyb6%2FOpmZvcWVsgXiBjq2YsqSfp3q0w8ifq2adopbAbsDOrqlmq5%2BjtG65wKyfrqijZA%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-song-mashups.html&text=All%20of%20the%20Mashups%20Taylor%20Swift%20Performed%20on%20Her%20Eras%20Tour&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-song-mashups.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-song-mashups.html&title=All%20of%20the%20Mashups%20Taylor%20Swift%20Performed%20on%20Her%20Eras%20Tour" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-song-mashups.html&title=All%20of%20the%20Mashups%20Taylor%20Swift%20Performed%20on%20Her%20Eras%20Tour" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-song-mashups.html&title=All%20of%20the%20Mashups%20Taylor%20Swift%20Performed%20on%20Her%20Eras%20Tour" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2ftaylor-swift-eras-tour-song-mashups.html&description=All%20of%20the%20Mashups%20Taylor%20Swift%20Performed%20on%20Her%20Eras%20Tour" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./reforme-de-la-tp-des-simulations-en-ligne-pour-chaque-collectivite.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="des simulations en ligne pour chaque collectivit">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./27-photos-that-show-how-mandy-moores-style-has-changed-over-the-years.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="27 photos that show how Mandy Moore's style has changed over the years">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
