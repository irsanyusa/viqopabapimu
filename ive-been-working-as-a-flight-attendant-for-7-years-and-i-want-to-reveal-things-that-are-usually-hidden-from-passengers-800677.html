The money she had was only enough for a&nbsp;one-way ticket to&nbsp;the city, that’s why she went straight to&nbsp;the job interview right after she got off the train. She successfully passed the interview and medical check and started her studies the same day! And though changing a&nbsp;life this drastically is&nbsp;extremely scary, being 21&nbsp;is the right time for&nbsp;it.</p><p>We&nbsp;at&nbsp;<strong>Bright Side</strong> read Claudia’s blog where she reveals interesting little details of&nbsp;flight attendants’ work and we&nbsp;are eager to&nbsp;share the professional secrets of&nbsp;this young flight attendant with you.</p><p><h2>People have stopped seeing flight attendants as&nbsp;people who are just going through a&nbsp;phase. Now they rarely ask, “When are you going to&nbsp;find a&nbsp;normal job?”</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/58c/42b/fadf4954b3920efc4fd5854284.jpg><p>A&nbsp;flight attendant is&nbsp;one of&nbsp;the people responsible for passenger safety&nbsp;— it’s not just the person who brings you tea and coffee, but also the one who will save your life if&nbsp;an&nbsp;accident occurs. Moreover, this profession requires mental stability. Just imagine what working in&nbsp;a&nbsp;confined space, where you are responsible for<strong> the safety and high-quality service</strong> for a&nbsp;huge crowd of&nbsp;people is&nbsp;like. Add stressful situations, red-eye flights, drastic climate and time zone changes, and hundreds of&nbsp;questions from passengers to&nbsp;this.</p><ul><li>The main quality you need in&nbsp;this job is&nbsp;flexibility.</li><li>You should be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;multitask and solve several issues at&nbsp;once.</li><li>Smiling is&nbsp;a&nbsp;must too. No&nbsp;matter what is&nbsp;happening in&nbsp;your personal life, your work is&nbsp;not the place where you should show&nbsp;it.</li><li>You should take care of&nbsp;your health because drastic changes in&nbsp;pressure and frequent flights are no&nbsp;joke.</li><li>A&nbsp;flight attendant should be&nbsp;<a href=# title=communicative data-link=tag>communicative</a> and be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;find an&nbsp;approach to&nbsp;talk to&nbsp;any passenger. Moreover, they should be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;regularly work on&nbsp;a&nbsp;new team, because every flight has a&nbsp;different crew.</li><li>The most important thing is&nbsp;healthy sleep. Even when you come to&nbsp;a&nbsp;different country, sightseeing is&nbsp;not as&nbsp;important as&nbsp;sleep.</li></ul><p><h2>How the senior flight attendant sees a&nbsp;flight</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/bb2/288/edcbbd54c5909c1e36e7817d15.jpg><p>I&nbsp;wake up&nbsp;at&nbsp;4&nbsp;AM to&nbsp;organize a&nbsp;flight at&nbsp;8&nbsp;AM. When all the crew members arrive, I&nbsp;hold a&nbsp;briefing, give them information and answer the crew’s questions regarding the flight, and ask them questions too. Afterward, we&nbsp;get on&nbsp;the plane. By&nbsp;the rules, we&nbsp;are supposed to&nbsp;be&nbsp;onboard one hour prior to&nbsp;the flight, but&nbsp;I like to&nbsp;get there earlier. As&nbsp;for&nbsp;me, it’s better to&nbsp;calmly sit and drink tea while waiting for passengers, than rush to&nbsp;the plane in&nbsp;high heels and make mistakes in&nbsp;a&nbsp;panic.</p><p>Then a&nbsp;real race starts for the senior flight attendant because all types of&nbsp;services come onboard: cleaning, technicians, engineers, etc. At&nbsp;this moment <strong>everyone needs something from the senior flight attendant</strong>. “Who is&nbsp;the senior?” “Check the cleaning, please!” “Put your signature here, please” “Dial the cockpit&nbsp;— we&nbsp;need to&nbsp;check the connection.” I&nbsp;have to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;check everything in&nbsp;order to&nbsp;have a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;fix malfunctions if&nbsp;any are detected. After a&nbsp;certain time, the captain allows&nbsp;us to&nbsp;start boarding and&nbsp;I call my&nbsp;colleagues by&nbsp;speakerphone, “Come to&nbsp;the cabin!” The girls put on&nbsp;forage-caps and wait at&nbsp;the doors. I&nbsp;can hear the sound of&nbsp;the first passengers’ steps approaching the plane.</p><p><h2>Each flight attendant has passengers who they see more often than their colleagues.</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/13c/b7d/da75b1535c9258db6c7f282b38.jpg><p>Sometimes when&nbsp;I meet passengers at&nbsp;the door, I&nbsp;see HIM. We&nbsp;have been on&nbsp;the same flight many times. We&nbsp;have common jokes, I&nbsp;know which coffee he&nbsp;likes, and&nbsp;I ask whether he&nbsp;was able to&nbsp;meet the deadline for his last project. I&nbsp;love these flights! While these passengers are sure that they will get perfect service.</p><p>Sometimes things get even funnier. One of&nbsp;my&nbsp;regular passengers was a&nbsp;middle-aged man who has desperately been trying to&nbsp;draw my&nbsp;attention and get my&nbsp;phone number. Being fully sure that it&nbsp;was our last meeting, I&nbsp;said&nbsp;I would give him my&nbsp;phone number if&nbsp;we&nbsp;ever met each other onboard again. After several days, he&nbsp;appeared onboard. I&nbsp;was as&nbsp;shocked as&nbsp;he&nbsp;was because<strong> he&nbsp;was with his wife and kids</strong>. After this situation, he&nbsp;never talked to&nbsp;me&nbsp;again.</p><p><h2>Life hacks for passengers in&nbsp;the airport</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/032/b89/46cda850668299adc3de86217f.jpg><ul><li>When booking seats for 2&nbsp;people, choose a&nbsp;window and aisle seat&nbsp;— no&nbsp;one wants to&nbsp;sit in&nbsp;the middle and you may have the entire row to&nbsp;yourselves.</li><li>If&nbsp;you are flying in&nbsp;economy class, line up&nbsp;for check-in closer to&nbsp;the business class counters. There are usually no&nbsp;lines in&nbsp;them and sometimes they start to&nbsp;check-in the passengers from the economy class who stand nearby.</li><li>Normally, security check baggage belts on&nbsp;the left are less loaded because right-handed people instinctively put their belongings on&nbsp;the right.</li><li>If&nbsp;you are going by&nbsp;bus to&nbsp;board the plane, don’t rush to&nbsp;occupy your seat, otherwise, you’ll have to&nbsp;spend 20&nbsp;more minutes in&nbsp;it&nbsp;and will either get cold or&nbsp;go&nbsp;crazy from the heat.</li><li>If&nbsp;you want to&nbsp;save money and wrap your suitcase with a&nbsp;plastic film, do&nbsp;it&nbsp;in&nbsp;the airport because security check officers might decide to&nbsp;check your baggage and they won’t care whether you have a&nbsp;plastic film on&nbsp;it&nbsp;or&nbsp;not.</li><li>Keep in&nbsp;mind that sometimes baggage gets lost, that’s why essential items must be&nbsp;stored in&nbsp;carry-on baggage.</li><li>Take a&nbsp;photo of&nbsp;your luggage. If&nbsp;it&nbsp;gets lost, you’ll have a&nbsp;photo on&nbsp;your phone to&nbsp;identify the loss.</li></ul><p><h2>How to&nbsp;save money when buying tickets</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/948/c6f/3ce5eb5a31a5d1c4268430b4af.jpg><ul><li>Check prices on&nbsp;several ticket selling platforms because the difference in&nbsp;price might be&nbsp;significant. The extended search is&nbsp;a&nbsp;worthy function&nbsp;— it&nbsp;can help you see all available tickets from a&nbsp;certain city and choose where to&nbsp;go. Indicate the whole country instead of&nbsp;a&nbsp;certain city and tick the “Add nearby airports” option. You will manage to&nbsp;find the cheapest available option by&nbsp;doing this.</li><li>Choose flexible dates. Check for all flight options for the nearest dates (± 3&nbsp;days).</li><li>Watch the price reduction. They keep changing constantly&nbsp;— not every month but every hour.</li><li>The cheapest way to&nbsp;buy tickets is&nbsp;one year prior to&nbsp;the planned trip, 2-3 months prior to&nbsp;the flight (if&nbsp;you are flying by&nbsp;a&nbsp;low-coster), several days prior to&nbsp;the flight (if&nbsp;you are flying on&nbsp;a&nbsp;charter flight or&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;flight with a&nbsp;big air company in&nbsp;low-season);</li><li>Buy burning tours to&nbsp;get cheap tickets. The full <a href=# title=travel data-link=tag>travel</a> pack is&nbsp;sometimes cheaper than tickets. Not only will you get a&nbsp;direct flight, but also a&nbsp;transfer and a&nbsp;prepaid hotel as&nbsp;a&nbsp;bonus.</li><li>Use incognito mode while searching for tickets&nbsp;— it&nbsp;will make the system think that you are a&nbsp;new visitor to&nbsp;the site and they will try to&nbsp;sell you tickets at&nbsp;a&nbsp;cheaper price to&nbsp;get you “hooked.”</li><li>Make sure you collect bonuses (or&nbsp;miles). For that, you need to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;bonus card first and then freely spend miles on&nbsp;buying new tickets or&nbsp;on&nbsp;buying goods onboard.</li></ul><p><h2>The specifics of&nbsp;a&nbsp;flight attendant’s life</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/9f9/cff/1b221c50faaff3a403e9e4d1b9.jpg><ul><li>You have no&nbsp;idea what weekday it&nbsp;is. Friday doesn’t seem as&nbsp;magical.</li><li>Instead of&nbsp;saying “Hello” on&nbsp;the phone, you say your name.</li><li>When filling in&nbsp;any documents, you always add your Personnel Number.</li><li>You have suitcases of&nbsp;various sizes for business trips. You don’t remember where you bought them&nbsp;— they are simply standing in&nbsp;a&nbsp;line on&nbsp;your balcony.</li><li>You have 4,587,327 alarms set for any time of&nbsp;the day on&nbsp;your phone.</li><li>Your wallet is&nbsp;full of&nbsp;coins but you can’t leave tips in&nbsp;a&nbsp;cafe because they are coins from different countries.</li><li>Even when you fly as&nbsp;a&nbsp;passenger, you instinctively shut all the overhead compartments. People around look puzzled at&nbsp;you and only the flight attendants understand that you are one of&nbsp;them.</li><li>When guests leave your home, you say to&nbsp;everyone, “All the best. Goodbye!”</li><li>100% messages from your cell operator are greetings about arriving in&nbsp;a&nbsp;new country.</li><li>When you get a&nbsp;phone call from the control room, you start to&nbsp;think, in&nbsp;a&nbsp;panic, that you have mixed up&nbsp;the date of&nbsp;the flight.</li><li>You find yourself perplexed quite often about what and how to&nbsp;wear clothes in&nbsp;everyday life because your entire wardrobe is&nbsp;thought out for you at&nbsp;work.</li><li>Personal life is&nbsp;not about romance and flowers. It’s all your time apart from flights, sleeping, and moments when you are ironing your uniform.</li></ul><p><h2>How to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;relationship if&nbsp;you are a&nbsp;flight attendant</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/f86/307/145d655a27839d1325a1af5cb1.jpg><ul><li>Let’s start with the fact that seeing each other will take place only when the person responsible for planning your schedule will let you have a&nbsp;day off. And if&nbsp;the flight attendant has had many flights before this day, it&nbsp;won’t be&nbsp;a&nbsp;day off but a&nbsp;sleeping day.</li><li>So&nbsp;you decided to&nbsp;give flowers to&nbsp;a&nbsp;flight attendant? Perhaps she will have a&nbsp;business trip and come back only when the flowers fade. Pot flowers are also not a&nbsp;good option&nbsp;— keep in&nbsp;mind she is&nbsp;oftentimes away from home.</li><li>It’s useless to&nbsp;plan dates because she only knows her schedule 2-3 days in&nbsp;advance.</li><li>It’s likely that you’ll celebrate significant dates, like Valentine’s Day and other milestones, by&nbsp;Skype.</li><li>She might come home as&nbsp;a&nbsp;usual office worker at&nbsp;6&nbsp;pm or&nbsp;at&nbsp;4&nbsp;am. She might not show up&nbsp;at&nbsp;all. The good thing is&nbsp;that she will not snow you under with her texts because she has no&nbsp;cell reception at&nbsp;work.</li><li>Your social circle will consist of&nbsp;flight attendants and partially of&nbsp;their boyfriends who work as&nbsp;pilots. At&nbsp;the same time, she will want to&nbsp;communicate with “ground” people and talk about anything except aviation.</li><li>If&nbsp;she sincerely loves her profession, you can “get her on&nbsp;the ground” only if&nbsp;she is&nbsp;on&nbsp;maternity leave.</li><li>Finally, here is&nbsp;the nicest bonus: if&nbsp;you decide to&nbsp;marry a&nbsp;flight attendant, you’ll get big discounts on&nbsp;air tickets. The main thing is&nbsp;to&nbsp;get married for love, not for the discount, to&nbsp;be&nbsp;able to&nbsp;enjoy those discounts together.</li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/1f2/e8a/629d8e5e3da0430579a4be50a3.jpg><p>In&nbsp;fact, we&nbsp;have more free time than the average person. <strong>We&nbsp;work 80&nbsp;hours a&nbsp;month</strong>, while an&nbsp;office worker works twice as&nbsp;much. But unfortunately, this doesn’t mean we&nbsp;can spend the rest of&nbsp;the time the way we&nbsp;want. After a&nbsp;night flight, for example, the next day won’t be&nbsp;full. Sometimes your boyfriend invites you on&nbsp;a&nbsp;date 3&nbsp;days in&nbsp;advance and one day prior to&nbsp;it, you find out you have a&nbsp;flight the next day. This happens quite often.</p><p>But if&nbsp;you trust each other, it&nbsp;doesn’t matter how many business trips you have or&nbsp;that you are absent from home several evenings in&nbsp;a&nbsp;row&nbsp;—<strong> it’s possible to&nbsp;build a&nbsp;relationship with this kind of&nbsp;job</strong> too. We&nbsp;have many couples with kids and they live a&nbsp;happy married life. Yes, sometimes it’s difficult to&nbsp;plan something, but everything is&nbsp;discussable.</p><p><h2>Tempting business class</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/699/ccf/f3357b5c409b6967f96e2fc329.jpg><p>Oftentimes, passengers <strong>try to&nbsp;cheat the system </strong>and change their seats for a&nbsp;business class seat during the flight. But flight attendants see everything. It’s prohibited to&nbsp;increase the service class onboard, this can only happen at&nbsp;the check-in counter. And still, people try to&nbsp;do&nbsp;it. Sometimes they buy 3&nbsp;business class tickets and 1&nbsp;economy class ticket; they say a&nbsp;kid can’t sit there alone and ask&nbsp;us to&nbsp;let them sit in&nbsp;business class all together.</p><p>Here are the top phrases from these passengers:</p><ul><li>“Have you no&nbsp;mercy?”</li><li>“It’s vacant anyway!”</li><li>“I&nbsp;am not asking you to&nbsp;feed&nbsp;me, I&nbsp;just want to&nbsp;sit here!”</li><li>“My&nbsp;neighbor is&nbsp;sneezing and snoring.”</li><li>“There is&nbsp;not enough space for my&nbsp;leg.”</li></ul><p>There are 1,000 and 1&nbsp;excuses for why “I&nbsp;can’t stay in&nbsp;economy class.” When they can’t get what they want, they start to&nbsp;actively offer&nbsp;us money. Sometimes all this is&nbsp;done so&nbsp;they can sit in&nbsp;a&nbsp;comfortable chair for a&nbsp;while and take a&nbsp;photo, other times so&nbsp;they can spend the entire flight in&nbsp;business class.</p><p><h2>A&nbsp;flight attendant might be&nbsp;restricted from getting onboard</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/8ce/090/b99f695ce58ae9499ffad889f3.jpg><ul><li>So&nbsp;you come to&nbsp;the airport to&nbsp;catch a&nbsp;flight and forget one tiny document. It’s so&nbsp;tiny and so&nbsp;unnecessary in&nbsp;your opinion. Will they let you onboard without&nbsp;it? No!</li><li>Here is&nbsp;another situation: you are asked questions about rescue procedures during the briefing. You can hardly answer one, even harder&nbsp;— the second question and can’t say a&nbsp;word about rules for the use of&nbsp;rescue equipment. <strong>This employee can literally kill passengers</strong> and that’s why they are not allowed on&nbsp;the flight either.</li><li>Or&nbsp;you decided to&nbsp;become creative and you came up&nbsp;with an&nbsp;idea to&nbsp;get a&nbsp;bright yellow manicure on&nbsp;your nails. Moreover, you added 5&nbsp;golden rings and put on&nbsp;fishnet tights. Though no&nbsp;one will argue with your taste, you won’t be&nbsp;allowed on&nbsp;board. Other flight attendants are there to&nbsp;replace you.</li></ul><p><h2>How I&nbsp;“cheated” a&nbsp;passenger for €280</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/76a/b2c/4336565888b6b2d9b5893584e4.jpg><p>At&nbsp;that point, I’d been working as&nbsp;a&nbsp;flight attendant for only one month. I&nbsp;went to&nbsp;business class to&nbsp;offer guests the chance to&nbsp;purchase onboard goods. There were a&nbsp;man and a&nbsp;woman sitting in&nbsp;neighboring seats. She placed an&nbsp;order and&nbsp;I went to&nbsp;get it&nbsp;for her. When I&nbsp;came back, the woman was not there. It&nbsp;was ok&nbsp;because the man she was flying with was in&nbsp;his seat. “€280, please,” I&nbsp;say. He&nbsp;gives me&nbsp;€300, I&nbsp;give him the goods and try to&nbsp;find the change. Suddenly the woman comes back, looks at&nbsp;us surprised, and asks, <strong>“Why is&nbsp;he&nbsp;paying for my&nbsp;order?”</strong> Me, “Aren’t you together?” She replies, “I&nbsp;don’t know this man.”</p><p>My&nbsp;world turned upside down during this pause. “Ok, your bill is&nbsp;€280,” I&nbsp;said after&nbsp;I got the order from her “husband.” Of&nbsp;course, we&nbsp;gave back all the money to&nbsp;the man. But the comicality of&nbsp;the situation still impresses&nbsp;me. The man obediently paid and took the bag with cosmetics not even looking at&nbsp;what was there. Then he&nbsp;returned it&nbsp;obediently and continued to&nbsp;watch the movie without showing any sign of&nbsp;being surprised.</p><p><h2>How we&nbsp;spend business trips?</h2></p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/b0c/6e1/ce9b775c57a4f975e616177288.jpg><p>It&nbsp;doesn’t matter whether I&nbsp;am in&nbsp;New York or&nbsp;in&nbsp;some small town, it&nbsp;doesn’t matter whether I&nbsp;am going to&nbsp;stay there for a&nbsp;day or&nbsp;for a&nbsp;week&nbsp;— each trip is&nbsp;unique. <strong>It’s an&nbsp;incredible opportunity</strong> to&nbsp;see the world with your own eyes. But now&nbsp;I understand that if&nbsp;I&nbsp;am feeling bad, I&nbsp;won’t make myself go&nbsp;outside and will simply stay in&nbsp;the room despite a&nbsp;strong wish to&nbsp;go&nbsp;for a&nbsp;walk. However, in&nbsp;the first year of&nbsp;work&nbsp;I wanted to&nbsp;see everything. No&nbsp;sleep for 2&nbsp;days? It’s ok&nbsp;— I&nbsp;am ready to&nbsp;walk 10&nbsp;miles on&nbsp;foot in&nbsp;a&nbsp;new city.</p><p>Here are the answers to&nbsp;the most frequent questions about business trips:</p><ul><li>All accommodation and meals are paid for by&nbsp;the company.</li><li>We&nbsp;stay in&nbsp;various hotels: from the ones which we&nbsp;want to&nbsp;leave as&nbsp;soon as&nbsp;possible, to&nbsp;the ones with perfect conditions that we&nbsp;don’t want to&nbsp;leave, even to&nbsp;go&nbsp;sightseeing.</li><li>Most often we&nbsp;either sleep or&nbsp;walk&nbsp;— everything depends on&nbsp;our mood. However, we&nbsp;pay for all of&nbsp;the extra excursions and entertainment by&nbsp;ourselves. When I&nbsp;just started to&nbsp;work, I&nbsp;wanted to&nbsp;try everything so&nbsp;I could spend more money on&nbsp;the trip than&nbsp;I earned for&nbsp;it.</li></ul><p>It&nbsp;was worth going from Irkutsk to&nbsp;Lake Baikal and covering 45&nbsp;miles to&nbsp;see that endless turquoise ice. I&nbsp;would probably never have visited some of&nbsp;such places without having this job. If&nbsp;I&nbsp;get a&nbsp;chance to&nbsp;go&nbsp;to&nbsp;the seaside for at&nbsp;least one day, I&nbsp;go there and really soak everything&nbsp;in. Your environment changes so&nbsp;often that everything looks nice to&nbsp;you&nbsp;— gloomy Moscow or&nbsp;sunny Spain&nbsp;— I&nbsp;look at&nbsp;everything with delight.</p><p>Would you like to&nbsp;connect your life with aviation?</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZLa3sYybnJ6mXay8s7fIp55mmaNirm6yy6KeoaxdlsG1sc2dmKesXZu8s3mWZrCemaKoeqK6w2agZq%2BRo8FuwM5mqZ6ulZa5bsDHoqWgq12ptaLAjJqpnmWlqMKiuMuyZKGhlJmyr3nFq6amZaCWwLSxzaCcq6tdbX1xgpZwZg%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2five-been-working-as-a-flight-attendant-for-7-years-and-i-want-to-reveal-things-that-are-usually-hidden-from-passengers-800677.html&text=Ive%20Been%20Working%20as%20a%20Flight%20Attendant%20for%207%20Years%20and%20I%20Want%20to%20Reveal%20Things%20That%20Are%20Usually%20H&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2five-been-working-as-a-flight-attendant-for-7-years-and-i-want-to-reveal-things-that-are-usually-hidden-from-passengers-800677.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2five-been-working-as-a-flight-attendant-for-7-years-and-i-want-to-reveal-things-that-are-usually-hidden-from-passengers-800677.html&title=Ive%20Been%20Working%20as%20a%20Flight%20Attendant%20for%207%20Years%20and%20I%20Want%20to%20Reveal%20Things%20That%20Are%20Usually%20H" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2five-been-working-as-a-flight-attendant-for-7-years-and-i-want-to-reveal-things-that-are-usually-hidden-from-passengers-800677.html&title=Ive%20Been%20Working%20as%20a%20Flight%20Attendant%20for%207%20Years%20and%20I%20Want%20to%20Reveal%20Things%20That%20Are%20Usually%20H" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2five-been-working-as-a-flight-attendant-for-7-years-and-i-want-to-reveal-things-that-are-usually-hidden-from-passengers-800677.html&title=Ive%20Been%20Working%20as%20a%20Flight%20Attendant%20for%207%20Years%20and%20I%20Want%20to%20Reveal%20Things%20That%20Are%20Usually%20H" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2five-been-working-as-a-flight-attendant-for-7-years-and-i-want-to-reveal-things-that-are-usually-hidden-from-passengers-800677.html&description=Ive%20Been%20Working%20as%20a%20Flight%20Attendant%20for%207%20Years%20and%20I%20Want%20to%20Reveal%20Things%20That%20Are%20Usually%20H" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./risque-inondation-les-projets-experimentations-et-solutions-de-linrae.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="les projets, exprimentations et solutions de lInrae">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./hallmark-plus-streaming-price-movies-1236066626.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Hallmark+ Streaming Service to Launch in Fall, Will Include First Holiday Limited Series, Orig">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
