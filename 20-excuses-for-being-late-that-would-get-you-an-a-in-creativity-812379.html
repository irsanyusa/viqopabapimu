Was late for an&nbsp;8&nbsp;am because the night before, I&nbsp;slept in&nbsp;the hallway of&nbsp;one of&nbsp;our class buildings doing homework (we&nbsp;had sofas and desks around there, so&nbsp;it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;nice and quiet place to&nbsp;study, also open 24/7). Woke up&nbsp;around 8:30 and ran to&nbsp;my&nbsp;class which was one floor above the one I&nbsp;was. The professor excused me&nbsp;and told me&nbsp;I could skip his class because they saw me&nbsp;sleeping there and said something along the lines of&nbsp;“at&nbsp;least you were doing your assignments, so&nbsp;I’ll let you go&nbsp;this time”.. <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;asamihitsuka&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Not me&nbsp;but my&nbsp;program coordinator told the story at&nbsp;orientation. Girl was a&nbsp;really good student. Always on&nbsp;time, studies like crazy, good grades. Overall close to&nbsp;a&nbsp;perfect student. Pass or&nbsp;fail exam comes, and she’s a&nbsp;no-show. They call her, text her, email her.&nbsp;3&nbsp;hours after the exam starts, she walks in&nbsp;with an&nbsp;IKEA catalog and the name and phone number of&nbsp;the manager written on&nbsp;it. She had been stuck inside a&nbsp;broken-down elevator there. She had no&nbsp;cell service in&nbsp;the elevator, so&nbsp;she couldn’t call and explain. They let her start the exam in&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate room.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;QuixoticDame&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>A&nbsp;student turned in&nbsp;a&nbsp;paper that was singed around the edges. His claim was he&nbsp;and his girl were getting romantic, and a&nbsp;candle lit his drapes on&nbsp;fire and&nbsp;I guess he&nbsp;pretty much burned his whole side of&nbsp;the house down.

Obviously, the teacher thought he&nbsp;was skipping class, so&nbsp;they asked them why they took so&nbsp;long to&nbsp;use the bathroom, and the kid said that he&nbsp;ran out of&nbsp;toilet paper... and had to&nbsp;use his sock instead. Sure, sure enough, he&nbsp;was only wearing one sock. Normally I&nbsp;would think it&nbsp;was just a&nbsp;joke, and they had some logical reason for only wearing one sock.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Reddit-User-3000</a> <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>/ Reddit</a></li><li>Not a&nbsp;teacher, but in&nbsp;primary school, we&nbsp;had a&nbsp;senile cat, it&nbsp;peed all over my&nbsp;workbook, I&nbsp;thought about&nbsp;it, realized the teacher would not believe&nbsp;me, so&nbsp;I carefully double-bagged it&nbsp;in&nbsp;2&nbsp;plastic bags &&nbsp;brought it&nbsp;to&nbsp;school. I&nbsp;ran to&nbsp;school, just made it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the bell, teacher asks where my&nbsp;workbook&nbsp;is, I&nbsp;tell her, “the cat peed on&nbsp;it” she says, “don’t lie, where is&nbsp;your workbook?” so&nbsp;I pick up&nbsp;the plastic bag, put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;the table and tear open the plastic, the book had dried, but the smell was so&nbsp;bad the teacher gagged, she got me&nbsp;to&nbsp;write my&nbsp;lessons on&nbsp;a&nbsp;separate paper sheet for the day and never accused me&nbsp;of&nbsp;lying again.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Dyingforsomelove&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Electricity went out in&nbsp;the middle of&nbsp;winter while&nbsp;I lived in&nbsp;a&nbsp;dry cabin with an&nbsp;iguana and a&nbsp;bearded dragon.

She was seriously late to&nbsp;class, and when confronted, she —normally a&nbsp;meek and non-confrontative human being— snarled at&nbsp;the prof, “Well, my&nbsp;cat was giving birth, I&nbsp;had to&nbsp;stay with her, didn’t I?!” She got off scot-free.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;S34d0g&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Parent was a&nbsp;volunteer first responder. Parent got a&nbsp;call while student and smaller sibling were eating breakfast and student had to&nbsp;drop off smaller sibling at&nbsp;school, thus missing the bus. We&nbsp;didn’t buy it&nbsp;at&nbsp;first, but we&nbsp;let it&nbsp;slide. Then at&nbsp;the parent-teacher conference a&nbsp;month later, the parent confirmed the story. It’s hard to&nbsp;get mad at&nbsp;a&nbsp;16-year-old kid for taking responsibility.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;Jumbobog&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>A&nbsp;friend of&nbsp;mine showed up&nbsp;2&nbsp;hours late without homework and without his backpack. The teacher, of&nbsp;course, was mad and asked him why he&nbsp;was so&nbsp;late and without his work. My&nbsp;friend replied that his little brother had thrown his backpack in&nbsp;his room, locked the door, and shoved the main key and spare key under the crack so&nbsp;the door could not be&nbsp;opened. Of&nbsp;course, the teacher did not believe him... That is&nbsp;until my&nbsp;friend showed him the security video of&nbsp;the event.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;maskedghostwolf&nbsp;/ Reddit</a><br></li></ul><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/wl-brightside.cf.tsp.li/resize/728x/jpg/913/6b9/4455a65e549d1b05c86f5e480b.jpg><ul><li>Not a&nbsp;teacher but a&nbsp;student. This happened when&nbsp;I was in&nbsp;9th grade (15-16 years old). So&nbsp;it&nbsp;was the first lesson after lunch. Two boys were missing when the teacher took attendance. Since it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;small town school, people were always missing, and literally, no&nbsp;one cared. About 20&nbsp;minutes into class, the missing boys knock on&nbsp;the door to&nbsp;our classroom. “Sorry for being late, but we&nbsp;got a&nbsp;free pizza and didn’t know what to&nbsp;do&nbsp;with&nbsp;it!”. In&nbsp;their hands was a&nbsp;family-sized pizza. The boys explained they had eaten lunch at&nbsp;the town’s only pizza place. When they were about to&nbsp;leave, the pizza chef asked if&nbsp;they wanted a&nbsp;free family-sized pizza because someone had called and ordered it&nbsp;but never retrieved&nbsp;it. The boys had then tried to&nbsp;fit the pizza into one of&nbsp;their lockers, but the box was too big to&nbsp;fit into a&nbsp;locker. Their solution: Bring it&nbsp;to&nbsp;class! Of&nbsp;course, the teacher didn’t let them have the pizza in&nbsp;the classroom. They had to&nbsp;put it&nbsp;on&nbsp;a&nbsp;table in&nbsp;the hallway. Luckily, no&nbsp;one ate it&nbsp;while it&nbsp;was out there, and the boys could enjoy their free meal when that lesson was over! Best excuse I’ve ever heard! <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;wishiwasmegmccaffrey&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>Not&nbsp;me, but my&nbsp;aunt was a&nbsp;teacher. She was really frustrated one day when a&nbsp;kid said that he&nbsp;had literally been attacked by&nbsp;a&nbsp;rabid dog, which chased him up&nbsp;a&nbsp;tree and he&nbsp;got stuck. Turns out the firefighters had to&nbsp;get him.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;A_G00d_B0i&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>On&nbsp;the last day of&nbsp;my&nbsp;senior year, I&nbsp;finally had a&nbsp;license, so&nbsp;I was like, “Yes! I&nbsp;get to&nbsp;drive myself to&nbsp;school at&nbsp;least once before graduating!” Got lost for three hours. Ended up&nbsp;having to&nbsp;stop at&nbsp;a&nbsp;Dunkin’ Donuts four cities away and use wifi to&nbsp;look up&nbsp;directions. When I&nbsp;finally showed&nbsp;up, it&nbsp;turned out&nbsp;I was about 10&nbsp;minutes past the cutoff point for “acceptable lateness,” meaning&nbsp;I had to&nbsp;call my&nbsp;mom and tell her what had happened in&nbsp;front of&nbsp;the principal. Great memory. My&nbsp;sense of&nbsp;direction has not improved ten years later.

Showed up&nbsp;to&nbsp;my&nbsp;first class in&nbsp;tears, my&nbsp;teacher had to&nbsp;ask what was wrong, and&nbsp;I was excused from classes and sent to&nbsp;a&nbsp;counselor. So&nbsp;it&nbsp;wasn’t true that I’d crushed a&nbsp;tiny person, but it&nbsp;was true that&nbsp;I thought I&nbsp;did.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;jemdamos&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>College math class. I’d burned my&nbsp;hand and was taking painkillers. I&nbsp;could take 3&nbsp;and still function, but that morning in&nbsp;my&nbsp;sleep-addled state, I’d taken 3&nbsp;as I&nbsp;was getting ready, forgot, and took 3&nbsp;more as&nbsp;I was running out the door. Realized what I’d done about 10&nbsp;seconds later, thought, “oh&nbsp;no,” and went to&nbsp;class. I&nbsp;had a&nbsp;good relationship with the teacher, and she knew about the hand already, so&nbsp;when&nbsp;I got to&nbsp;class&nbsp;I just told her what happened and that&nbsp;I felt fine now but that&nbsp;I didn’t know what was gonna happen. She just told&nbsp;me, “sit in&nbsp;the back, if&nbsp;the formulas I’m writing start melting off the board, just get up&nbsp;and go&nbsp;home.” <a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;NotThtPatrickStewart&nbsp;/ Reddit</a></li><li>My&nbsp;math teacher said the best excuse he&nbsp;ever got for a&nbsp;student not getting homework finished was that there was a&nbsp;cow in&nbsp;her pool. My&nbsp;understanding was that it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;family effort to&nbsp;get the cow out and that the cow was in&nbsp;danger, and it&nbsp;was a&nbsp;lengthy process. I’m not entirely sure what went down, and I&nbsp;am still wondering if&nbsp;there was a&nbsp;fence around the pool... and if&nbsp;so, what kind of&nbsp;Houdini bovine stuff went down.&nbsp;<a rel="noopener noreferrer nofollow" href=#>©&nbsp;sporknife&nbsp;/ Reddit</a><br></li></ul><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmiaop60qcDSopueZp2afKK%2B06KapZ2jZH9xecSxmq6rlah6p7vRZpmeoZ6ceq2t055kraCRqXq4u9Slm2aflal6urvUZpinZZFitq95wqucmqyZq7a1xYxxaGtrZ258</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2f20-excuses-for-being-late-that-would-get-you-an-a-in-creativity-812379.html&text=20%2b%20Excuses%20for%20Being%20Late%20That%20Would%20Get%20You%20an%20A%2b%20in%20Creativity&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2f20-excuses-for-being-late-that-would-get-you-an-a-in-creativity-812379.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2f20-excuses-for-being-late-that-would-get-you-an-a-in-creativity-812379.html&title=20%2b%20Excuses%20for%20Being%20Late%20That%20Would%20Get%20You%20an%20A%2b%20in%20Creativity" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2f20-excuses-for-being-late-that-would-get-you-an-a-in-creativity-812379.html&title=20%2b%20Excuses%20for%20Being%20Late%20That%20Would%20Get%20You%20an%20A%2b%20in%20Creativity" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2f20-excuses-for-being-late-that-would-get-you-an-a-in-creativity-812379.html&title=20%2b%20Excuses%20for%20Being%20Late%20That%20Would%20Get%20You%20an%20A%2b%20in%20Creativity" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2f20-excuses-for-being-late-that-would-get-you-an-a-in-creativity-812379.html&description=20%2b%20Excuses%20for%20Being%20Late%20That%20Would%20Get%20You%20an%20A%2b%20in%20Creativity" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./frances-tiafoe-us-open-semifinal-carlos-alcaraz.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Frances Tiafoe Might Save American Men's Tennis">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./zdf-enterprises-sloborn-2-1234945764.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="ZDF Enterprises Boards Slborn 2 as Co-Producer and Worldwide Distributor (EXCLUSIVE)">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
